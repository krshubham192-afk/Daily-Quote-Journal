✍️ How It Works
Quotes are stored in a local array of 100+ motivational messages.

A random quote is selected and displayed on page load and when the "Next Quote" button is clicked.

Users can write a reflection and save it to a favorites list.

Each saved entry includes the quote, author, and personal note.

💡 Future Improvements
Persist favorites using localStorage

Add quote categories (e.g., success, mindfulness, creativity)

Enable export of journal entries

Integrate with a quote API for fresh content
